Benchmark directory
===================

Place benchmark definitions, task specs, and evaluation outputs here.

Suggested layout:
- specs/: task and dataset definitions
- metrics/: metric implementations or references
- results/: outputs (ignored by git; store summaries or small CSVs only)

Keep large raw datasets in data/raw and processed artifacts in data/processed.
